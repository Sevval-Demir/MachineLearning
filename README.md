# üß† Machine Learning Projects ‚Äì BTK Academy

Hi there! I'm **≈ûevval Demir**, and this repository contains all the hands-on coding exercises I completed while following the [BTK Academy Machine Learning Course](https://www.btkakademi.gov.tr/portal/course/python-ile-makine-ogrenmesi-11800).

Each topic is organized into folders and includes Python scripts and datasets used throughout the learning process.

## üìÅ Project Structure

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Bolum1/` | Data preprocessing: handling missing values, encoding categorical data, and preparing datasets |
| `Classification/` | Classification algorithms like KNN, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Decision Trees |
| `Clustering/` | Customer segmentation using K-Means clustering |
| `Apriori/` | Market basket analysis using the Apriori algorithm |
| `Regression/` | Regression techniques: linear, polynomial, SVR, and Decision Trees |
| `Prediction/` | Real-world prediction examples (e.g., salary, sales prediction) |
| `PCA/` | Dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis |
| `DL/` | Deep Learning with Keras ‚Äì e.g., ANN for churn prediction |
| `NLP/` | Natural Language Processing ‚Äì sentiment analysis on text data |
| `UCB/` | Reinforcement learning ‚Äì Upper Confidence Bound algorithm for ad selection |
